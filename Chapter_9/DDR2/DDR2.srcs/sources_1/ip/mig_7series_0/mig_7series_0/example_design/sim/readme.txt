MIG outputs script files required to run the simulations for Modelsim, 
Vivado Simulator, IES and VCS. These scripts are valid only for running 
simulations for "Open IP Example Design"

1. How to run simulations in Modelsim simulator

   A) sim.do File :

      a) The 'sim.do' file has commands to compile and simulate memory
         interface design and run the simulation for specified period of time.

      b) It has the syntax to Map the required libraries (unisims_ver,
         unisim and secureip). The libraries should be mapped using
         the following command
         vmap unisims_ver <unisims_ver lib path>
         vmap unisim <unisim lib path>
         vmap secureip  <secureip lib path>

         Also, $XILINX_VIVADO environment variable must be set in order to compile glbl.v file

      c) Displays the waveforms that are listed with "add wave" command.

   B) Steps to run the Modelsim simulation:

      a) The user should invoke the Modelsim simulator GUI.

      b) Change the present working directory path to the sim folder.
         In Transcript window, at Modelsim prompt, type the following command to
         change directory path.
            cd <sim directory path>

      c) Run the simulation using sim.do file.
         At Modelsim prompt, type the following command:
            do sim.do

      d) To exit simulation, type the following command at Modelsim prompt:
            quit -f

      e) Verify the transcript file for the memory transactions.

2. How to run simulations in Vivado simulator

   A) Following files are provided :

      a) The 'xsim_run.bat' is the executable file for Vivado simulator under
	     MicroSoft Windows environment.
		 
      b) The 'xsim_run.sh' is the executable file for Vivado simulator under
	     Linux environment.
		 
	  c) The 'xsim_run.bat'/'xsim_run.sh' file has commands to compile and 
	     simulate memory interface design and run the simulation for specified 
		 period of time.

	  d) xsim_options.tcl file has commands to add waveforms and simulation 
	     period.
		 
	  e) xsim_files.prj file has list of rtl files for simulating the design.
		 
      f) $XILINX_VIVADO environment variable must be set in order to compile 
	     glbl.v file

   B) Steps to run the Vivado Simulator simulation:

      a) Change the present working directory path to the sim folder of "Open
         IP Example Design" path in the OS terminal.

      b) Run the simulation using xsim_run.sh file under Linux environment and
	     xsim_run.bat under MicroSoft Windows environment.

      c) Verify the transcript file for the memory transactions.

3. How to run Cadence IES Simulations

   A) ies_run.sh File :

      a) The "ies_run.sh" file contains the commands for simulation of the
         hdl files.

      b) Libraries must be added to the "ies_run.sh" file before running
         simulations. Following lines must be added to the file, just below the
         comment line #libraries path#

         ncvlog -work worklib -messages $XILINX_VIVADO/data/verilog/src/unisims/*.v >> ies_sim.log
         ncvlog -work worklib -messages $XILINX_VIVADO/data/verilog/src/retarget/*.v >> ies_sim.log
         ncvlog -work worklib -messages -file $XILINX_VIVADO/data/secureip/secureip_cell.list.f >> ies_sim.log

         Also, $XILINX_VIVADO environment variable must be set in order to
         compile glbl.v file and the above mentioned library files

   B) Steps to run the IES simulation:

      a) Change the present working directory path to the sim folder of "Open
         IP Example Design" path in the OS terminal.

      b) Run the simulation using ies_run.sh file. Type the following command:
         ./ies_run.sh

      c) Verify the ies_sim.log file for the memory transactions.

4. How to run Synopsys VCS Simulations

   A) vcs_run.sh File :

      a) The "vcs_run.sh" file contains the commands for simulation of hdl files.

      b) Libraries must be added to the "vcs_run.sh" file before running
         simulations. Following lines must be added to the file, just below the
         comment line #libraries path#

         vlogan $XILINX_VIVADO/data/verilog/src/unisims/*.v >> vcs_sim.log
         vlogan $XILINX_VIVADO/data/verilog/src/retarget/*.v >> vcs_sim.log
         vlogan -f $XILINX_VIVADO/data/secureip/secureip_cell.list.f >> vcs_sim.log

         Also, $XILINX_VIVADO environment variable must be set in order to
         compile glbl.v file and the above mentioned library files

   B) Steps to run the VCS simulation:

      a) Change the present working directory path to the sim folder of "Open
         IP Example Design" path in the OS terminal.

      b) Run the simulation using vcs_run.sh file. Type the following command:
         ./vcs_run.sh

      c) Verify the vcs_sim.log file for the memory transactions.

5. SIM_BYPASS_INIT_CAL parameter value of SKIP, skips memory initialization sequence
   and calibration sequence. This could lead to simulation errors since design is not
   calibrated at all. Preferred values for parameter SIM_BYPASS_INIT_CAL to run
   simulations are FAST and OFF.
